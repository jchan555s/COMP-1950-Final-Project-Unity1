	<p>Our proposed redesign of the 1950 website will be the best that the students of BCIT have ever seen.
	BCIT prides itself for offering the best quality education for students to enter the workforce.
	The new design will use the latest web technologies such as HTML 5.0 and CSS3 to bring state of the 
	art tools for learning and making education fun and exciting, helping students entering the workforce 
	to be the best educated.</p>

	<p>The website has one purpose in mind and that it is to bring the information to the students as quick 
	as possible.  If offers a clean look preventing information overload on students who need to absorb as 
	much information in as little as 10 weeks.  It will offer an effective navigation that will all 
	students to retrieve any information in as little as 2 steps.  There are 4 (TBD) main sections: 
	lecture notes, exercises, homework, quizzes, resources, curriculum, timetable, room information, 
	grading, and bcit policies. (to be discussed how to organize this)  The items are context sensitive,
	meaning that if week3 hasn't occurred yet, the homework or quizzes,etc will not be available until 
	published by the administrator. (note: need administrator login to administrator this)</p>
	
	<p>Gone are the handouts of quizes and exams on paper.  The website will allow students to take exams 
	online and get feedback immediately!</p>
	
	<p>The internal structure is highly flexible which will allow for upgrade to new technologies as time 
	progresses.  The website allows for easy and quick updates by the site administrator.</p>

	<p>NOte:site needs to link to bcit.ca, my.bcit.ca, & course description on bcit.ca.
	We need to mentioned where we used jQuery or CSS and why.</p>
