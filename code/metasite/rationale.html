	<p>Our proposed redesign of the 1950 website will be the best that the students of BCIT have ever seen.
	BCIT prides itself for offering the best quality education to help students enter the workforce.
	The new design will use the latest web technologies such as HTML 5.0 and CSS3 to bring state of the 
	art tools for learning and making education fun and exciting, helping students entering the workforce 
	to be the best educated.</p>

	<p>The website has one purpose in mind and that it is to bring the information to the students as quick 
	as possible.  If offers a clean look preventing information overload on students who need to absorb as 
	much information in as little as 10 weeks.  It will offer an effective navigation that will alllow
	students to retrieve any information in as little as 2 steps.  There are 5 main sections: 
	lecture notes, exercises, quizzes, resources, and course info.  The menu items are context sensitive,
	meaning that if  hasn't occurred yet, the homework or quizzes,etc will not be available until 
	published by the administrator. (note: need administrator login to administrator this)</p>
	
	<p>Sample new features... Each lecture is bookmarked by heading/topic allowing for quick access
	to sub-topics within a lecture.  Gone are the handouts of quizes and exams on paper.  The website will 
	allow students to take exams online and get feedback immediately.
	
	<p>The internal structure is highly flexible which will allow for upgrade to new technologies as time 
	progresses.  With HTML 5, lectures recorded in video or audio could be uploaded and played. 
	 css3: maybe used: rounded corners, RGBA colors , transitions</p>
	 
	<h2>New Feature Highlights</h2>
	
	<h3>Lectures</h3>
	
	<h3>Exercises</h3>
		
	<h3>Quiz</h3>
	<p>The quiz section allows students to take practice quizzes, review previous quizzes that have been
	submitted, or take quiz.  The complete list of quizzes will be listed but only quizzes that have been
	administered by the teacher will be enabled. Quizzes are multiple choice.  Once submitted, students
	will be able to find out their score right away.The quiz will then appear enabled in the
	Completed Quiz list section.
	</p>
	
	
	
	We need to mentioned where we used jQuery or CSS and why.</p>
	
	<p>List Features planned to implement but could not complete</p>
