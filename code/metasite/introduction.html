	<p>This is the proposal for the redesign of BCIT's COMP 1950 webpage.  Our client: Jeff Parker
	would like to redesign the website to better meet the needs of the students. The main function
	of the webpage is to allow students to have easy access to the lecture material, exercises,
	and resources.</p>
	
	<p>The redesign will have new features such as online quizes and possibily online submission for 
	homework as well as the feedback from the teacher directly associated with the submission.  The
	website will come complete with a new and refreshing style that will make learning COMP1950 fun
	and exciting.</p>
	
	<p>The web design team of Calvin Sun, Sean Johnson, and Jason Chan will ensure that the website
	redesign will meet and exceed Jeff Parker's expectation.</p>
