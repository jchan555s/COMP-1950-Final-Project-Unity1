NOTE:
1.  There will be no link from the proto-site back to the metasite.
    I think the proto-site should be self contained.
2.  The meta site will have a different design than the proto-site
    as per requirements.
	
*NOT REQUIRED
1.  browse, search, login, view news, send email, call, explore. 
    We can mention this in the rationale that these could be done.           Jason     No
2.  Use of BCIT logo - do not do this.
3.  Do not make GUI work with smartphones.  -not required and 
    wasting valuable time.
4.  Do not use CMS - not required and waste of time.  Can 
    mention in rationale that it could be used.                              Jason     No
5.  Do not fully implement the online quiz.  Do not validate                 Jason     No
    or lockout user after timeout.                    
6.  Do not implement protecting of these pages from invalid                  Jason     No
    users.  Just mention in the rationale how this would work.

    and using up precious time.
